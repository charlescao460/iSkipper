Cost of Materials
----
(In the Chinese Market)

$1.37 Atmega328P-AU (Need to burn Arduino bootloader before soldering)

$1.72 RFM69HW

$0.41 CH340G

$0.94 PCB

$1.56 Connectors, antenna, capacitors, oscillators, resistors.

$FREE My soldering

Total: $6 (12% of the expensive iClicker2)

Notes
------
ATmega328P is working on 5 voltage, but RFM36HW requires 3.3 voltage. However, shockingly, they are stable and durable in daily use.
